In addition to consuming large amounts of food, Rattata also pack a vicious bite. They can potentially pass diseases through puncture wounds. Their teeth never stop growing, so they must constantly gnaw on hard objects to whittle them down or risk starvation, unable to close their mouths.

Additionally, Yungoos are diurnal and wary of human cities. Their introduction only selected for Rattata to be nocturnal and urban in habitat, creating the variant we know today as Alolan Rattata. These Pok\u00e9mon are troublesome household pests just like their mainland cousins, gnawing entrances into homes at night. Their whiskers help them locate fresh food, which they bring back to their nests for Alolan Raticate. Alolan Rattata actually will actively avoid spoiled meals, unlike their relatives. This is because of their hierarchical social structure; while mainland Rattata forage for themselves, Alolan Rattata must please their boss Alolan Raticate and select food accordingly.

They search for food on these nightly flights, which,contrary to popular belief and unlike the diets of their evolutions, consists mostly of nectar, fruits, and Berries. As daylight approaches, Zubat must return to their caves or other dark places, as the light of the sun can burn their delicate skin. To stay warm on cold nights, they will huddle together in groups as they sleep.

Galarian Meowth were likely originally bred to simply have thicker coats to help them withstand frigid northern temperatures. However, this changed over time into breeding Meowth that could help trainers in battle--sharper claws and sturdier bodies both were desirable traits that eventually led to the Galarian Meowth we see today, possessing both iron fur and claws. In modern times, these Pok\u00e9mon can be found wherever these seafaring raiders had pillaged--including Galar.

Still, they try to venture onto land in order to strengthen their legs, though they will flee into the water at the first sign of danger. Their skin is so thin that light can pass through it, rendering it transparent. The spirals on their belly, actually their innards, can differ in direction depending on which side of the equator the Poliwag was born; those with clockwise spirals are from the northern hemisphere, while those with counter-clockwise ones are from the southern hemisphere.. Their skin must be kept moist at all times--when not in the water, they are in constant danger of drying out.  As a result, they rarely stray too far from the water\u2019s edge (if they leave it at all). Their thin skin also leaves Poliwag particularly vulnerable to water pollution, which they can easily absorb. Their swirls will pale when they are ill. However, this skin is also very flexible and slippery, bouncing off the fangs and claws of attackers. Poliwag primarily feed on algae and lily pad roots.

Thanks to special organs that sense the earth\u2019s rotation, these Pok\u00e9mon have one of the most accurate internal clocks in the world. All Hoothoot in a forest will hoot at precisely the same time every day, together, without fail. They are nocturnal Pok\u00e9mon that can often be seen sleeping in tree hollows during the day. Curiously, although they have two feet, they always stands on only one, even when sleeping. Like metronomes, Hoothoot sometimes rock back and forth to steady rhythms, with each sway being equivalent to\u00a0one second; each second is a \u201ctick\u201d in their swaying. Hoothoot can be trained to hoot at a specific time every day, and for that reason, often are used in place of alarm clocks and watches for trainers traveling across regions. Their unbelievably precise readings of the time have led them and their evolution Noctowl to be revered as wise and all-knowing in the past, or even as divine messengers.

A common legend is that Onix living to be over 100 years will have experienced enough force to compress their bodies and become Steelix. In the wild, scientists believe that age has little to do with their evolutions; Onix evolve into Steelix as they eat through rock and absorb the iron within.

Relatedly, populations of these Pok\u00e9mon skyrocketed in the wake of the Galarian Industrial Revolution as factory runoff spilled into Galarian seas.

Mudkip sleep by burying themselves in the mud. They spend roughly equal time on land and in the water, but must keep their skin moist so they don\u2019t dry out and become lethargic.

This quality along with their hydrodynamic body shape allows them to reach speeds of up to 75 mph (120 km/h) by jetting water through their bodies.

Wailmer eat tons of plankton daily, filtering water through their sieve-like teeth (actually baleen). If they lose too much of their stored water, they will begin to dry out and become lethargic. Kind beach-goers will often take the time to dump buckets of water onto dry Wailmer to rejuvenate them.

They join their separate brains via magnetic nervous systems to utilize psychokinetic powers at double strength. Like Beldum, Metang float above the ground using magnetic force. They can fly around quickly, easily reaching speeds of over 60 mph (100 km/h); when they do so, they rotate their arms so that their claws face rearwards like thrusters, streamlining their silhouettes. These powerful claws can tear through thick iron sheets like silk. Their bodies are incredibly hard; crashing straight into jet planes wouldn\u2019t scratch them. Their two separate brains do not make them more intelligent than Beldum, but do make them think twice as fast; Metang are very useful for solving complex equations or cracking passwords through brute force, as they can use both of their brains to test possible solutions in half the time. In battle, Metang have can wield a much wider variety of attacks their pre-evolutions, using moves like Metal Claw and Zen Headbutt to take down foes. They will chase down prey and then grasp them tightly with their two claws to bring them down.", "Regions Found": ["alola", "unova"], "Locations Found": ["unova giant chasm", "alola poke pelago"], "Environment Found": ["Cliffs", " canyons", " badlands"], "Image": "https://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/large/metang.jpg", "Pokedex Entries": ["When two BELDUM fuse together, METANG is formed.

Decidueye can fire feathers within a tenth of a second and over half a mile (0.8 km) away. It is said that they shoot with enough strength to pierce a pebble over 100 yards (90 meters) away. Decidueye can nock and shoot within a tenth of a second, and can expertly curve their arrow quills to strike unsuspecting foes. Decidueye can fire barrages of arrows into the air so that they rain down on many foes beneath them. Though they no longer are as fussy as Dartrix and usually remain calm and collected, they can sometimes become very flustered when taken by surprise. They sometimes pull on the vine on their head as a security blanket of sorts to improve their focus.

Though Rolycoly are afraid of water, they will undergo a quick burst of speed when crossing through a puddle of it as their internal engines convert it to steam. Unsurprisingly, Rolycoly were first discovered about 400 years ago just before the Galarian Industrial Revolution, when miners unearthed a massive coal deposit near Motostoke. The Pok\u00e9mon quickly found their way into homes across the region, supplying coal for domestic purposes. The advent of the revolution led to a swift decline in wild Rolycoly numbers, though, just as they were first unearthed, as the coal they relied upon for survival was being rapidly consumed by human industry. This die-off continued until public outcry led to new regulations on coal mining and environmental protection. Today, historians credit this defense of Rolycoly as the first modern environmental movement.
